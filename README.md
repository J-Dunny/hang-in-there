# Hang In There: Paired Project

## Overview:

We created a website that allows you to generate a random poster and create a custom poster. Users are able to save any poster they created. We built this application only using Javascript to manipulate the DOM.

The site allows users to:
* Generate a random Poster
* Create a customized poster
* Save any poster whether it was random or customized
* Display all saved posters
* Delete a saved poster

## Generate a Random Poster:

The website will generate a random poster when the page loads. Users can also generate a random poster by clicking the button, "Show Another Random Poster".

## Generate a Custom Poster:

Users can create their own poster by following these steps:
1. Click the "Make Your Own Poster" button on the main page.
2. Fill out the form in the proper fields requesting the image url, title, and quote.
3. Click "Show My Poster" button.
4. The customized poster should be on display on the main page.
